## Purpose and Goals
The Intervention Model for Air Pollution (InMAP) is a powerful first step towards lowering key technical barriers by making simplifying assumptions that allow for streamlined predictions of PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations resulting from emissions-related policies or interventions.[^1] InMAP performance has been validated against observational data and WRF-Chem, and has been used to perform source attribution and exposure disparity analyses.[^2]<sup>,</sup> [^3]<sup>,</sup> [^4] The InMAP Source-Receptor Matrix (ISRM) was developed by running the full InMAP model tens of thousands of times to understand how a unit perturbation of emissions from each grid cell affects concentrations across the grid. However, both InMAP and the ISRM require considerable computational and math proficiency to run and an understanding of various atmospheric science principles to interpret. Furthermore, estimating health impacts requires additional knowledge and calculations beyond InMAP. Thus, a need arises for a standalone and user-friendly process for comparing air quality health disparities associated with various climate change policy scenarios.

The ultimate goal of this repository is to create a pipeline for estimating disparities in health impacts associated with incremental changes in emissions. Annual average PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations are estimated using the [InMAP Source Receptor Matrix](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1816102116) for California.

## Documentation

This website serves as the living documentation for the ECHO-AIR model. The navigation pane on the left will help you navigate through Getting Started, Running the Code, Technical Code Details, and any other additional supporting information.

Currently, the model is configured and validated for California ISRM calculations. In the near future, I will validate it on the national ISRM as well.
