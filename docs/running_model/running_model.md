## Running the Model
The model is configured to be run on a Linux Terminal. It has been tested on Mac OS Terminal, Windows Subsystem for Linux, Google Cloud Console, and UC Berkeley's Savio Supercomputer. The following sections walk through the process to run the tool. Note that there may be subtle differences depending on your operating system.

The following instructions assume you have already configured the model. If you have not, please follow the instructions for [Getting Started](https://echo-air-model.github.io/docs/getting_started/getting_started.html) before continuing.
