## Limitations

ECHO-AIR has limitations and is not a replacement for full comprehensive chemical transport modeling of PM<sub>2.5</sub>.

ECHO-AIR relies on simplifying assumptions used to improve model efficiency, a reduced scope of emissions input data, and simplifying assumptions in calculating exposure concentration. The results are recommended for use as a screening-level analysis for investigating the relative magnitude of disparities from minor perturbations in emissions from different sources, sectors, and release environments. These results are not a substitute for more complex modeling of total PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations and exposure concentrations, nor can it produce time-resolved or seasonal results.
