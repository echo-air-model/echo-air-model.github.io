## MacOS Prerequisites
The model was developed on MacOS Monterey on the Apple M1 with 16 GB Memory. The instructions below may need to be adapted for Mac machines.

### Install Python
In order to run the ISRM Tool, the computer must have Python installed. I recommend following the guidance provided by [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/) for downloading Python on Mac. It is also recommended that you install Anaconda Navigator for ease setting up a virtual environment.
