## Prerequisites

There are a few prerequisite steps that must be taken prior to the model set-up. The steps will assume some knowledge of Linux terminal commands. A summary of key commands can be found on the [Linux Cheat Sheet page](https://echo-air-model.github.io/docs/other_information/linux_cheat_sheet.html).

This section of the documentation is organized by operating system.
