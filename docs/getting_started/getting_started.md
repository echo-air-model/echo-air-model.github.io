Below are a list of instructions to follow for the first time you set up your model directory for running ECHO-AIR Model calculations. These instructions fork into separate operating systems when necessary. 

Note that in code blocks where it says `[your_name]`, it should be replaced by your username and where it says `[your/path/here]`, it should be replaced with the path to your directory.

This process only needs to be done once. Once your set-up is configured, you can skip these instructions and [Run the Model](https://echo-air-model.github.io/docs/running_model/running_model.html).
